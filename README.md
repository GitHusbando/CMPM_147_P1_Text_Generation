#Bestiary Excerpt Generator

The code uses context-free grammars to create a whimsical bestiary entry which describes a made-up animal.

I was trying to make a silly little generator that doesn't necessarily make too much sense, and I think I achieved that. I would have liked to make it have more variation, but I don't think I have the time.

The addition type of replacement I used was replacing general words/tokens with specific multi-word phrases, including words of multiple types.
